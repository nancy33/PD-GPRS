## Genome-wide Polygenic Risk score Identifies Individuals at Elevated Parkinson's Disease Risk

In Han and Teeple et al., Parkinsonâ€™s Disease inherited risk is quantified by a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PD-GPRS) approach using 6.2 million variants and data from 80,777 individuals. For the top 2.5% and 1% of PD-GPRS, individuals had five- and seven-fold greater odds of PD, respectively. PD-GPRS was found to be associated with overall PD risk, earlier age of onset, and MDS-UPDRS motor scores. Genes nearest to variants observed at higher frequencies among high-GPRS individuals are enriched for PD-implicated pathways.
